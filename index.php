          <p>We would do a format of yoga then dance with instructional pauses to discuss the flower essences, chakras, and how they connect. There will 7 podiums with corellating flower essence and chakra/spa. These podiums will have some vocabulary and explanations of what they can modify or assist with. Would like to pair with Flora Arcana Flower Essences & Maya Smith or another rad Yogi.</p>

        <p>Dr. Edward Bach was a British Physician, who began to see disease as an end product, a final stage, a physical manifestation of unhappiness, fear and worry. He therefore, began to look to nature to find healing flowers. Over a period of years Dr. Bach found 38 healing flowers and plants that with the right preparation became the 38 Bach Flower Remedies. These remedies are enough to remove all negative emotional problems.</p>
        <p>The Bach Flower Remedies is a safe and natural method of healing. They gently restore the balance between mind and body by casting out negative emotions such as fear, worry, hatred and indecision which interfere with the equilibrium of the being as a whole. The Bach Flower Remedies allow peace and happiness to return to the sufferer so that the body is free to heal itself.</p>
        <p>The Bach Flower Remedies are made 100% naturally from spring water infused with wild flowers, either by the sun-steeped method or by boiling. The Remedies are hand produced exclusively in England. The Remedies contain 27% grape based brandy as a preservative. Or the alcohol free versions are preserved in glycerin made from sunflowers.
